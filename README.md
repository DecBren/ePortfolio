  - During week 4 of COIT11239 we did a conflict management scenario where we were given a fake scenaro and we had to come up eith ideas to rectify the mistake and ways for the people to make up. Teh scenario mentioned was two students that were working on a report and one of them did not do their job. The solution me and my team came up with was to confront the person and get them to do it but also help so that it could be done on time.[Document](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FDecBren%2FePortfolio%2F349f78accf9ea0fc7ea4de1a8d64b6367d3903a2%2FWeek%25204%2520Conflict%2520Scenario.docx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK)
